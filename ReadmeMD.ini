[ScreenshotInfo]
* Mode 0: 160×200 pixels with 16 colors (4 bpp) (192×272 with borders)
* Mode 1: 320×200 pixels with 4 colors (2 bpp) (384×272 with borders)
* Mode 2: 640×200 pixels with 2 colors (1 bpp) (768×272 with borders)

A "Mode 3" exists with a trick, wich is a Mode 0 with 4 colors

There is a Full Screen Trick that allow to write pixels in border area. So we will stick with *384x272* and show full border. 

* MODE 0: 384×272. Original pixels will be 2 pixels wide in images.
* Mode 1: 384×272. 
* MODE 2: It's needed to use *768x544* to keep pixel accuracy. Original pixels will be 2 pixels height in images.
